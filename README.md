The project demonstrated here is a Push Button Counter using Arduino UNO, a simple yet effective digital electronics project widely used in embedded systems education. The aim is to increment a counter each time a push button is pressed and display the result in the Serial Monitor. This project not only introduces interfacing buttons with microcontrollers but also demonstrates the concept of digital input reading, state change detection, and serial communication in Arduino programming. The components used in this is Arduino UNO board Breadboard,Push Button,10kΩ Resistor (for pull-down),Jumper Wires,USB cable for power and Serial Monitor connection.The circuit is designed using Tinkercad, and the image clearly shows the layout. The connections are as follows:Push Button: One leg is connected to 5V (positive rail) of the breadboard.The opposite leg of the push button is connected to digital pin 2 of the Arduino.A 10kΩ pull-down resistor is connected between the button's output leg and GND to ensure a defined low state when the button is not pressed.The breadboard's positive rail is powered by the Arduino's 5V pin, and the negative rail is grounded via the Arduino's GND pin. This setup ensures that when the button is pressed, the signal at pin 2 becomes HIGH, and when it is released, the pull-down resistor pulls the input to LOW.The Arduino push button counter works by reading the digital input from a push button connected to pin 2 of the Arduino UNO. The code initializes the button as an input and sets up serial communication to display output on the Serial Monitor. Inside the loop, the current state of the button is read and compared with its previous state to detect a transition from LOW to HIGH, which indicates a valid button press. When this transition occurs, the counter is incremented and the updated value is printed to the Serial Monitor in the format “Button Pressed : X”, where X is the number of presses. A short delay is added to debounce the button, preventing multiple counts from one press. The circuit uses a pull-down resistor to ensure that the pin reads LOW when the button is not pressed, thus providing a stable digital reading. This entire setup allows for reliable counting of button presses and real-time display of the count, demonstrating fundamental principles of digital input handling, edge detection, and serial communication in Arduino-based embedded systems.This Push Button Counter project is a practical demonstration of how hardware and software interact in an embedded system. It teaches critical concepts such as digital I/O, button debouncing, and serial communication. The simplicity of this project makes it ideal for beginners, while its extensibility allows for more complex features like LCD display output, EEPROM storage, or multiple button inputs. You have successfully created a system that responds to user input and provides real-time feedback—an essential concept in the design of interactive systems.The working of this project is based on digital input signal reading and edge detection. When the push button is not pressed, the input pin connected to it reads LOW due to the pull-down resistor, which ensures a defined voltage level. When the button is pressed, the circuit connects the pin to 5V, and the pin reads HIGH. The Arduino detects this transition from LOW to HIGH using a conditional check that compares the current and previous states of the button. If the transition is detected, it is interpreted as a valid button press, and the counter is incremented. This method ensures that only one count is registered per press, avoiding issues caused by the button's mechanical bouncing. The use of a small delay further stabilizes the reading by preventing multiple detections of a single press. The counted value is then printed to the Serial Monitor
